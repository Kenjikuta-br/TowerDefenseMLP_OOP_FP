# Tower Defense: Comparing Programming Paradigms

This repository contains the development of a **Tower Defense game** implemented in **Python**, focusing on analyzing and comparing two programming paradigms: **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Functional Programming (FP)**.

## Project Goal

The goal is to explore the practical differences between programming paradigms through two complete and independent implementations of the same game, highlighting the strengths, challenges, and unique characteristics of each approach.

## Repository Structure

- **`oop_version/`**: Contains the game implementation using the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm. This version leverages concepts like classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to model the game.
- **`functional_version/`**: Contains the game implementation using the Functional Programming paradigm. This approach emphasizes pure functions, immutability, and functional composition.

## About the Game

**Tower Defense** is a game genre where the goal is to protect a base or territory by strategically placing towers to defend against waves of enemies.

### Planned Features:
- Towers with distinct characteristics (range, damage, cost).
- Enemies with varying speed, resistance, and quantity.
- Wave system with increasing difficulty.
- Simple interface (CLI or GUI, depending on scope).
